- Amazon ECS - Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that allows you to run, manage, and scale containerized applications on AWS.
- Amazon EKS - Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a fully managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes.
- AWS Fargate - AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Fargate allows you to run containers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure, such as EC2 instances or virtual machines.
- ALB - Application Load Balancer
- NLB - Network Load Balancer
- EJS - EJS, or Embedded JavaScript, is a templating engine for Node.js that lets you generate HTML with plain JavaScript. It allows you to create dynamic content by embedding JavaScript logic directly within HTML. EJS uses simple syntax for embedding JavaScript code, making it easy to generate and manipulate HTML content. Itâ€™s commonly used in web applications to render views and is particularly popular in combination with Express.js for server-side rendering.
- `tsconfig.json` - The tsconfig.json file configures the TypeScript compiler options, project structure, and type-checking rules, ensuring consistent behavior during development and compilation.
