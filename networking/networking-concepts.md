# Networking Interview Questions and Answer
Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim, Rabbish rahli sadri wa yassirli amri wah lul uqdatan min lisaani, yaf kahu kauli
Note: Please remember to stay calm and control your emotions. Tawakaltu Allahllah. Take your time and don't rush through the material. It's absolutely fine if you cover less ground, as long as you have a clear understanding of what you've learned. Prioritize the questions that you couldn't answer in your previous interview. Avoid manually updating the Table of Contents (TOC) section, as it should update automatically. If you do decide to update the TOC manually, ensure that it doesn't disrupt the layout of the questions section. Remeber, you cannot change anything but Allah can.

## What is the meaning of CIDR in AWS and how is it used to define networks and hosts?

In AWS, **CIDR** stands for **Classless Inter-Domain Routing**. It is a method used to define IP address ranges in a more flexible and efficient way than traditional IP addressing (like class-based networking). 

In the context of AWS, CIDR is commonly used to:
- Define IP address ranges for **VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds)**, **subnets**, and **security groups**.
- Specify ranges of IP addresses allowed for inbound and outbound traffic in security and network settings.

A **CIDR block** consists of an IP address followed by a suffix that indicates how many bits of the address are used for the network prefix. For example:
- `10.0.0.0/16`: This means that the first 16 bits are used for the network part of the address, leaving 16 bits for hosts, which allows for 65,536 addresses (2^16).
- `10.0.1.0/24`: This represents a smaller range where 24 bits are for the network and 8 bits for the host, allowing for 256 IP addresses.

In AWS, CIDR blocks are used to create and manage VPCs, subnets, and manage IP address allocation for networking.


## In IP addressing, what do the terms "network" and "host" mean, and how do they relate to CIDR notation?

In the context of **CIDR** and IP addressing, the terms **network** and **host** refer to two components of an IP address. These help define how devices (hosts) are identified within a network.

1. **Network**:
- The **network** part of the IP address identifies the specific network that the device belongs to. It is used to route traffic between different networks.
- The size of the network is determined by the **CIDR prefix** (the number after the `/`). For example, in `10.0.0.0/16`, the `/16` means that the first 16 bits of the IP address represent the network portion.
- All devices within the same network share the same network portion of the IP address.

2. **Host**:
- The **host** part of the IP address identifies individual devices (computers, servers, etc.) within the specified network.
- The remaining bits (after the network portion) of the IP address are used to identify unique hosts on that network.
- For example, in `10.0.1.5/24`, the network portion is `10.0.1` and the host portion is `5`. This means the device with IP `10.0.1.5` is one host in the `10.0.1.0/24` network.

Example: `10.0.1.5/24`
- **Network portion (`/24`)**: `10.0.1`. This defines the network as `10.0.1.0/24`, meaning any IPs that start with `10.0.1`.
- **Host portion**: `5`. This identifies a specific device (host) within the `10.0.1.0/24` network.

Key Concepts:
- **Network** = Defines which network a device belongs to (used for routing).
- **Host** = Identifies the individual device on that network.

In AWS, CIDR blocks define the size of your networks (VPCs and subnets), and the host portion determines how many unique IPs or devices you can have in that network.
